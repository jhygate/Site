I'm currently working at UJ an exciting insurtech starup, working to bring fairness and transparency and ease of use to the insurance industry.

I work in small, agile, cross functional teams where I help plan new features, scope functionality with the key stakeholders and implement them! I'm there from resourcing all the way up to code-review, final product testing , live feature monitoring and urgent fixes (not that we ever need any of those...)

I'm working mostly with Python in the backend and tooling, and Angular for the frontend as well as dabling in platorm work with AWS, Kubernetes, Docker and Gitlab CI/CD.

My favourite project has been working with the Data Science team to reafactor and rebuild thir ML pricing pipeline
. I helped optimise it from a multi-day process, to a 2 hour process, with increased visibilty, error handling,
tetsing and ease of use with Dagster, MlFlow and platform work.
